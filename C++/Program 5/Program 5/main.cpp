//Reflection
//I really enjoyed this assignment because it again forced me to learn new containers and use the standard library algorithms. I really learned a lot about maps, tuples, sets, and vectors.
//I think I made big strides in how I designed and implemented this program in a simple way. I had a lot of fun. It was pretty
